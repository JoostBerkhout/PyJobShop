# Flexible Job Shop Problem
This repository implements a constraint programming (CP) model for the flexible job shop problem (FJSP).
We consider a rich variant of the FJSP with many different constraints, such as arbitrary operations precedence relations, sequence-dependent setup times, and many more.
The implementation is currently work in progress and V1 is planned to be finished in 2024 Q2.
Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions.

We use IBM ILOG CP Optimizer to implement the CP model.
A Google OR-Tools alternative is work in progress, contributions to migrate the CP Optimizer model to OR-Tools are welcome.
